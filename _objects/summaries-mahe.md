## [2nd Session], [25.09.2024]
<!--one to two paragraphs of text summarizing the session-->

As a new student at the University of Luxembourg, more than a decade after earning my bachelor’s degree, the introductory course to digital history is quite challenging for me. Despite having taken an introductory course on information and communication techniques at ULB with Prof. Dr. Seth van Hooland, I must admit that I am not very familiar with new technologies. I have mostly relied on research using index cards, although I must acknowledge that the first time I accessed a source through the BNF’s online catalog, I was impressed. Not having to go to the precious reserve and wear gloves was a real pleasure and provided me with a comfortable and welcome working environment. The course itself on data and metadata was interesting and opens up possibilities. I see this seminar as a toolbox. I don’t know how to use these tools yet, and it will undoubtedly be a painful learning process, but with an interesting outcome: saving time and not having to manually write a bibliography or footnotes, which is probably more painful than learning the tools.
I will end with a question about data and metadata themselves: is having almost exhaustive data always a good thing for historians? Isn’t it the “natural” selection of what has been transmitted to us that sometimes makes the research process interesting? If a document has reached us, it is because it was of some importance. Was there any clear manipulation? Why are they unavailable? This is obviously a question to be approached with caution and nuance, but I sometimes feel overwhelmed by a torrent of information when it comes to digital history.

## [3rd Session], [02.10.2024]

The session on web archives allowed me to discover the benefits of tools like the “Way back Machine,” which provides snapshots of websites at chosen periods. This can be useful in historical research to capture a snapshot of opinions at a specific moment. Working in a group allowed us to focus on a specific topic, and it’s always a good exercise to present our ideas concisely to an audience. The other topics presented by fellow students gave me a limited but insightful understanding of the advantages web archiving can offer historians. This can be very interesting for recent history topics, as well as for collecting meta-data to correlate with more traditional research or to critique a previously formulated hypothesis, all while maintaining a certain restraint and critical thinking.
Ultimately, I would like to be able to search for information on the dark web to increase my chances of finding material. Web archiving seems to me to be a colossal task, an almost inexhaustible source of information. The real challenge, in this case, will be to effectively question the sources. If a methodological theme on this subject could be addressed, it would be very enriching.
This session also highlighted the issue of privacy protection and the right to protect personal data. I was personally surprised not to find any data about myself on the web, which is reassuring, but in the age of social media, it must be quite unusual. This is an important ethical consideration, especially when moving from metadata to microdata.

## [4th Session], [09.10.2024]

Working with Impresso has been very interesting for me. Although the tool is still being perfected and I faced quite a few difficulties initially, I have noticed a significant time-saving for my future research. Despite the search field being somewhat limited, having an overview at the metadata level and a very comprehensive Boolean search should make life easier for researchers. I remember sifting through periodicals on microfilms over a 30-year period 20 years ago; it was a tedious task. I believe that using Impresso should be done in conjunction with traditional sampling methods, and as Prof. Dr. Düring pointed out, one must always maintain a meticulous critical approach towards these tools, but the time savings are impressive.
Regarding the exercises conducted in class, I started my research alone before joining a group of three working on the League of Nations. We noticed the importance of defining the lexical field used for the search, as the League of Nations is also a football competition. The same applied to my initial research on masonry. I found an interesting article in the Wort, which could be useful for my master’s thesis. As for getting to grips with the tool, this is a first approach that deserves to be deepened, as I still have some difficulties using it. So, it’s learning by doing.
Regarding GitHub, I need to get used to the software as it is entirely new to me. However, in the long run, it shouldn’t be a problem given the basic usage that is required of us. Once again, it will be a matter of managing the available time to be as efficient as possible.

## [5th Session], [16.10.2024]

The session on interactive maps allowed me to grasp the richness of this resource, but also the complexity of the studied field. Once the difference between maps and GIS was addressed, I realized that the subject was rich but complex. The first exercise regarding the creation of a campus map is also revealing of how our life habits influence our operational mode, highlighting in a way the historian’s cherished difficulty of neutrality. The step-by-step approach is interesting and allows for a very general understanding of how ESRI or QGIS works.
The presentation of all these technologies useful to the historian’s profession is certainly fascinating, but also difficult to grasp in 90 minutes. I was fascinated by Jan Månsson’s “World Atlas of Travel Industry, 1860”. The work is considerable, almost exhaustive, intuitive, interactive, and remarkably precise. However, one question bothers me: despite a methodological explanation, we do not have sources to critique the given information, so we have to take Jan Månsson’s remarkable work at face value. Regarding the collective exercise carried out in class, I still notice my technological gaps, but I think that with work, they can be resolved, as StoryMaps has the same interface as PowerPoint. During our first reading, we did not notice the richness of the studied document, and it was by looking at the map intuitively that we were able to appreciate the richness of the studied document.
