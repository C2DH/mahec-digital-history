## Data Metadata & Tool 2 'Tropy', 25.09.2024
Before the course on “Data and metadata”, we also had to watch a video and read a text so that we could get an impression of the topic and gain a basic understanding. In the lecture we briefly saw what digital history is. Data are facts or pieces of information, and they come in many different types. So data are digital things that we collect, store, manipulate, examine, interpret, preserve and create/produce. We also learned what research data is, which are factual records used as primary sources for scientific research. Metadata are information about information, and is used to find, organize, identify, contextualise data and to evaluate an information. It allows us to filter objects by characteristics, tags and types. Metadata allows the researcher to organize the data sets. Through the examples and videos, it was easier to understand metadata and data. Whenever a term was explained, there were examples to help us visualise it, which was ideal. I also didn't realise that we also produce data or metadata in our everyday lives, for example by posting a tweet. So text, hashtag, time, date, etc. would be the metadata. Historians/researchers use data/metadate because they improve accessibility, organisation/classification, quality and accuracy/reliability of research. Unfortunately, the introduction via Tropy was very short and rapid. But I understood that Tropy allows us to organize, comment and describe photographs of research material, but it does not keep track of references (not organizing citation) and create bibliographies, alter photo files with advanced tools or publish the photo files online.


## Web Archives', 02.10.2024
In the course on web archives we got new impressions of different web archives, including how they work, what their problems might be and how useful they can be for historians/researchers. There were 7 different assignments. For each assignment we had to set up groups of 3-4 students and had 30 minutes to answer the different questions and divide the group work. At the end, each group had to present their results to the class. I worked with two other students on “Fluidity of the web” on Ranke.2, respectively on the historical narratives in constant motion, thus on a Wikipedia entry about September 11 attack. At the beginning, we worked individually and then presented our findings to each other. We had to analyse the revision history for editing changes. There were more grammar/spelling corrections, adding images/text/paragraphs, removing tags, correcting links and restructuring the text in the article. In this editing history, some bots were also found and make rapid repetitive semantic or semi-automatic edits, correcting spelling errors, removing vandalism and fixing formatting errors. Bots can’t recognize when databases include incomplete information or mistakes. Bots are created by humans, which means they depend on the assistance of humans, so the bot can adopt biases from the editors. Bots don’t focus on contextualisation, critical thinking or on ethical consideration. The collaboration between humans and bots changes how history is captured, produced and understood, so questions of reliability, objectivity and authenticity can arise. Historical narratives on Wikipedia are in constant flux. For example, the way historians analyse and write about the past can change over time, there are new discoveries, new historical research about a certain topic and different interpretations and perspectives. Wikipedia is publicly accessible, which means that anyone can edit the article, so incorrect information or even vandalism can occur. The aim of this exercise was to understand how collaborative technologies influence the moving nature of web content.

## Online Newspaper Archives & Tool 3 'Impresso', 09.10.2024
Before the course about "Impresso", we had to read an article to get an insight into the functions, the design process, the creation, the capabilities of the user interface and ideas behind Impresso. The first Impresso-project was a Swiss-Luxembourgish newspaper collection that was digitised and used for historical research. Impresso has various filter, discovery and search functions. This digital historical newspaper archive should enable researchers/historians to analyse, consult, use and interpret digitised newspapers in order to gain knowledge about the past. Historians play a major role in the creation and development of the Impresso project as they explain how the project can be improved. In a quick walkthrough, we were also shown the various functions such as Ngram, Filter, Inspect & Compare, Newspapers and Text Reuse. In order to avoid OCR errors, Impresso works with "word embedding", which means that words are taken that sound similar or different languages are taken into account and the different spelling variants are taken into consideration. The second Impresso-project integrates and enriches newspaper and radio sources in a single semantic space. We tried Inspect & Compare and used for query A "NATO-Doppelbeschluss" (99 results) and for query B "Helmut Schmidt" (6.190 results) and came to 24 common results. When we tried the newspaper filter and clicked on five different newspapers, no results came up for query A. When we experimented with the different topics in Query B, there were no common results. What was interesting was that there were no common results in 1979 between the two queries, as Helmut Schmidt played an important role in the implementation of the NATO Double-Track Decision. One also wonders what political orientation the newspapers had, as it influences how news is presented and interpreted.

## Maps & Tool 4 'StoryMaps', 16.10.2024
A critical attitude should always be taken towards maps, because the creation of a map is subjective The W-questions and the how-question should always be in our minds. My group chose the “World Atlas of travel industry, 1860” by Martin Jan Mansson, an enormous historical map of travel and trade routes in the 19th century, created mainly from the records of American and English travellers, explorers and industrialists. The perspective was therefore mainly Western and European. There was no mention in the map that Mansson used African, Arab or Asian journals, so their perspective of the trade and travel route map remains unknown. Was this intentional or unintentional? Because the trade route was also linked to the colonial period, in which Americans and Europeans were very active and you can also see in the “world map of selected goods” from where trade goods came and were exchanged between different continents. We mainly used the “text and image” option to create StoryMaps. The “John Snow Maps” also used images and text, but it looks more interactive because you can see how the maps changes by using different couches options. Snow’s map was used on a GIS-model, which supports the spatial understanding and has tremendous storytelling power, but can also be easily manipulated. Maps always depend on how the cartographer/geographer decides to create it and what his subject, interest and purpose is. His work is subjective and can be economically, politically, culturally, socially and environmentally influenced. A map can also be overwhelming if you find a lot of data in a map, as with such Mansson’s map. Snow's map is clearer and not as cluttered, respectively the GIS-model. This work has taught me how space can be characterised by different priorities of the creator and how this can be historically related (colonialism, trade networks, spatial distribution of cholera diseases).
