## Data and Metadata, 25/09/2024
During the session of the 25th of September, we discussed briefly the importance of Digital History nowadays and then started the first topic, which was “What are/is data”. Firstly, we discussed about the etymology of the word “data” to give a first definition and explained that Data are digital things which we create, collect or manipulate for example. Secondly, we talked about “metadata”, also called “information about information”. At a certain time, there was a need to historize metadata and so descriptive instruments like catalogs or index cards were invented to facilitate and organize information: research infrastructures or data repository are essential tools to make data accessible, findable, but also reusable. 
At the end of this session, the professor made a presentation about Tropy, which is a “specialized software to organize and describe photographs of research material” such as photos of documents studied in the archives for example. With Tropy, it is possible to organize and describe files of images of research material, but also to annotate and comment it. 
In general, the course was theoretical, and the rhythm was very fast, which made it complicated to listen and take good notes at the same time. Also, the presentation of Tropy was very brief and more explanations were needed to understand how to use the application properly.

## Web Archives, 02/10/2024
During the session of the 7th of October, the program consisted of working in groups of 3, during which we tackled a specific subject related to Web Archives. For our group, the topic was “Publishing family and personal archives on the web”. To complete this exercise, we began by reading a text that dealt with a particular case of personal archives on the web. It was about a site on which a person kept the memory of his grandfather who worked in the mines in the Netherlands: over time and with little activity on the site, the web page was transformed into a public website where anyone could post and write information about miners in the Netherlands. Then, with the help of site called “Wayback machine”, we discovered that it is possible to consult old versions of websites, some of which are more indexed than others depending on the year consulted. The rest of the group’s work consisted of consulting our own archives on the web: the result was not very enriching, but we were able to see that depending on our personal activities, there were traces relating to sport, schooling or even photos posted on social networks. At the end of our research, each group presented its findings to the class, followed by a discussion with the teachers. The class exercise was quite enriching, even if our research did not lead to any significant results. The fact that we were working in groups enabled us to exchange ideas and go into more detail on a subject.

## Impresso, 09/10/2024
During the session of the 9th of October, we discovered and learned how to use Impresso, a website that consists of a database containing a digitized collection of Swiss and Luxembourg newspapers. The site is currently in its first version, and we were also informed that a second version, with a more powerful search engine and a larger growing corpus of sources, is currently under development. 
The presentation of Impresso clearly demonstrated its strengths, but also its weaknesses. First and foremost, you must be careful to ask the site the right questions, so as not be misled: the selection of words, as well as the language and items selected in the search bar, must be done with precision, because as we saw during the course, non-exhaustive information can appear. Secondly, in a group work session, we were able to discover for ourselves the various functions of Impresso, by choosing a subject ourselves. The site’s main tool is the search bar, which can be used to carry out a more precise search using several filters such as years of production or newspaper titles. There is also a Ngram, which shows the dates of most publications. Two other functions are very interesting and relevant to a search: a comparator that lets you play with the filters to obtain concrete results, and a system that detects similarities in the writing of different texts.
The discovery of Impresso was quite enriching and the way the site works enabled us to see the weaknesses of the site. Even though the site works well, it would be interesting to analyze the second version, which will probably contain more content.
