## Online Newspaper Archives, 09/10/2024

The course got off to an exciting start with the introduction of a new platform, “Impresso”, which highlights the importance of newspapers as witnesses to past knowledge, where valuable ideas are preserved. I was a little skeptical about its use and real utility. However, thanks to the group work, I was able to see that this tool could be complementary, especially when combined with resources such as eluxemburgensia. My colleague and I compared the results obtained by searching for our villages, “Saeul” and “Bascharage” respectively. Not understanding why the term “Saeul” had (many) more mentions in newspapers than “Bascharage” - even in non-Luxembourg newspapers - we soon realized that the searches were confusing “Saeul” with the German term “Säule”.
During the course, I also discovered a new concept: the scientific term “OCR”, which I'd never heard of before. On the other hand, I found it a pity that the part devoted to the “Github” tool was dispatched in just 15 minutes. That was a lot of information to assimilate in a short space of time. Fortunately, we received a PDF file to guide us through the rest, which made it easier to understand the tool. Personally, not being very comfortable with technology, I sometimes find it difficult to master these tools. However, I realize that it's essential to take the time to explore them in greater depth, as they offer interesting opportunities for research, analysis and comparison.
