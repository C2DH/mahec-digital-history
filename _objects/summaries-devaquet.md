## [Data, Metadata & Tool 2 'Tropy'], [25.09.2024]
The beginning of the course dealt with the definition of a “digital historian”. The question of when a historian becomes a digital historian was raised, and the class was confronted with various viewpoints related to it. In the narrow sense, almost everyone today is a digital historian; in a slightly broader sense, it only applies to those who access digital tools and not just use digital sources.
Afterward, the term "data" was explained in more detail: Data are information used for reasoning, arguing, or calculating. In a humanistic sense, one can also understand data as capta.
It was shown that the significance of this term has increased in modern times, especially since digitization. Finally, it was listed how data can be handled, from creation to the modification of its properties and materiality.
When talking about digital data, one automatically talks about metadata. For this reason, the class was given an overview of what is understood by metadata and how to find it. Metadata is information about information. It helps organize and structure large amounts of data or differentiate between multiple versions of similar-looking data. Metadata is also used – especially by historians – to make assumptions about the given information. It helps to assess, for example, if a source is linked to a desired time period, if it originates from a transparent source, and so on.
Tropy ties in exactly here. It is a program used to annotate, comment on, and transcribe collected data, and thus it helps organize, hierarchize, and structure it. This works, for example, by creating 'projects,' adding keywords, and metadata.

## [Web Archives], [02.10.2024]
The lecture of the 2nd of October 2024 consisted of different group works. The group work that had been assigned to my group was about the dialogs created by different people, historians or bots working on a Wikipedia page. More precisely, we had to analyse what has been edited on the Wikipedia page from the nine-eleven assassination by using the edit history. During our analysis we found out that most of the changes done by users were minor grammar mistakes, correction, addition or updates of links, integrating a different picture or a source from another media. Between those small edits were also more significant ones, like for example the provision of new information or  the  deletion  of  redundant  or  unsuitable  text  passages. Among  noticeable  changes  were commentaries that had nothing to do with the article, so a kind of vandalism, or the removal of information where this didn’t seem appropriate, as the deleted information still seemed adequate. The interventions by bots were mostly the creation of hyperlinks to a further Wikipedia page or the correction of obvious grammar mistakes.
The topics from the other groups were more directly linked to actual internet archives. They mostly worked out problems with the sources of IAs, they gave an insight into the Luxembourg Web Archive, presented the old website of Luxembourg with the help of the “wayback machine” and compared it to the one from nowadays or analysed a YouTube video, the September 11 Digital Archive and the disappearing of the website “Mijn Museum – De Beukel”.

## [Online Newspaper Archives & Tool 3 'Impresso'], [10.10.2024]
The fourth course was divided into three parts. The first part introduced us to the importance of newspapers in historical research and the need to preserve newspaper archives. To summarise, the importance of newspaper archives lies in the fact that they can be used as primary sources in a variety of ways. Newspapers offer a rich and varied spectrum of information about the past. This part not only emphasised the value of newspapers, but also familiarised us with a corpus tool called Impresso. Impresso is a platform that archives Luxembourgish and Swiss newspapers. It improves accessibility for historical research by segmenting the newspapers and surpasses national borders by storing newspapers in different languages from both Luxembourg and Switzerland. The second part allowed us to apply the theoretical knowledge we had acquired. By searching a large corpus for striking elements, you quickly notice patterns and trends. In my group we analysed the frequency / million of the words coal and steel to check how this changed during industrialisation and after the creation of the ECSC. We tried to exclude OCR errors with the topics option, and we also used the snippets to check whether there was a peak in the frequency caused by frequent word use within a limited number of scanned sources. The third part of the course was a very quick exploration of the Github website. We were shown how to create a personal file and where to upload our summaries.

## [Maps and Tool 4 'Story Maps'], [17.10.2024]
The course "Maps and Tool 4 'Story Maps'" was divided into two parts. The first part was a brief introduction to the tool of maps. Ms. Schmid explained the role of maps as historical sources, gave us a brief insight into the history of maps, showed the different types of maps that exist (topographical and thematic), and introduced us to the term GIS (Geographic Information Systems). In this part, we learned, for example, that Google Maps was created only in 2007, while the earliest maps date back to at least the 6th century BCE. During the introduction to GIS, we saw how these systems combine different layers of geographical data.
The second part consisted of group work. Our group was assigned the "WORLD ATLAS OF TRAVEL INDUSTRY," created in 1860 by Martin Jan Månsson. It is a massive world map that incorporates extensive information about travel and trade goods. For example, it contains facts about goods, slavery, trading animals, trading habits of various nations, events related to the development of trade, and much more. Additionally, it includes two smaller integrated maps, a diagram, and a list of popular trade goods and their origins. Most of the sources used by the cartographer were written by English and American travelers, industrialists, and researchers of the 19th century. The map itself is a collection of stories told by contemporaries, including European, Russian, and American captains and travelers.
The John Snow Map, which the group next to ours worked on, deals with the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. It marks deaths in red and water pumps in blue across different layers. By calculating the area with the highest number of deaths, it was determined that the Broadwick Street water pump was the "hotspot" of the outbreak.
