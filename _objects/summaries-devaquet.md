## [General Introduction & Tool 1 'Zotero'], [18.09.2024]
The beginning of the course dealt with the definition of a “digital historian”. The question of when a historian becomes a digital historian was raised, and the class was confronted with various viewpoints related to it. In the narrow sense, almost everyone today is a digital historian; in a slightly broader sense, it only applies to those who access digital tools and not just use digital sources.
Afterward, the term "data" was explained in more detail: Data are information used for reasoning, arguing, or calculating. In a humanistic sense, one can also understand data as capta.
It was shown that the significance of this term has increased in modern times, especially since digitization. Finally, it was listed how data can be handled, from creation to the modification of its properties and materiality.
When talking about digital data, one automatically talks about metadata. For this reason, the class was given an overview of what is understood by metadata and how to find it. Metadata is information about information. It helps organize and structure large amounts of data or differentiate between multiple versions of similar-looking data. Metadata is also used – especially by historians – to make assumptions about the given information. It helps to assess, for example, if a source is linked to a desired time period, if it originates from a transparent source, and so on.
Tropy ties in exactly here. It is a program used to annotate, comment on, and transcribe collected data, and thus it helps organize, hierarchize, and structure it. This works, for example, by creating 'projects,' adding keywords, and metadata.
