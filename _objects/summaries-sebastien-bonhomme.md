## Summary of the 25th of September 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During the Introduction to Digital History lesson of the 25th of September 2024, we were introduced to a few key elements of digital history, namely who is and who isn’t a digital historian and what is data and the related metadata. A digital historian for example isn’t just any historian who uses digital tools, but all historians today are confronted with sources that are digitalised.
Data, initially a Latin loanword, became a proper English word in the late 18th century and meant “the admitted elements of a problem”. In our context, data are things/information we create, store, manipulate, analyse and interpret. On that matter, data used as sources for a historian’s work becomes “research data”.
Metadata, on the other hand, is, in short terms, the data of the data, the information around the information. Thus, for example, a picture file is the data, but its name, its date of creation and upload for example are metadata. There are two types of metadata, on one side embedded data, which the machine creates automatically, on the other, enriched data, which is created by the used/the historian.
We were also introduced to Trophy, a program that enables one to save, organize adequately and describe with tags image files used by historians as research data. In other terms, it is kind of like Zotero in many ways, but for images, although some key features of Zotero like the generating of citations is notably absent.

## Summary of the 2nd of October 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During the Introduction to Digital History lesson of the 25th of September 2024, we were acquainted with the concept of web archives in their vast array of forms as digital vaults key to storing a variety of data in all their forms. The lesson took, for this occasion, a more student-participative approach as we were divided into 6 groups to each present a different example and their aspects.
A first group presented the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization formed in 1996 which aims to preserve documents, files, songs, movies and websites on the Internet. Internet Archive must regularly face lawsuits by companies and labels accusing them of copyright infringement as many books are also made available on the archive. A second group presented a sort of Luxembourgish version of the Internet Archive called Luxembourg Archive, a project by the BNL which aims to preserve among others Luxembourgish Websites of which they take 4 screenshots every year. A third group presented the “Wayback Machine”, affiliated with the Internet Archive, a website that let’s one visit how a specific site looked like eons ago, if a version of it had been saved. A fourth group analysed the “revision history” of a Wikipedia article, showing a variety of details and changes made over time, some useful, and some cases of vandalism.
The fifth group presented archives on a more personal level, the family, with images, but also by presenting how they themselves had shared data and information regarding family online as is subconsciously done frequently by many people.
The final group presented the September 11th Digital Archive, an archive with the goal of preserving data and a variety of media, partially made available by private persons, related to the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attack on the Twin Towers.

## Summary of the 9th of October 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During the lesson of the 9th of October, we were first familiarized with the “Impresso” project and app, an initially swiss-luxembourgish collaboration, now incorporating partners from other countries, that, via a current corpus of over 70 Swiss and Luxembourgish Newspapers, aims at significantly improving the way researchers in the field of History consult, find, use and then interpret data from the selected newspapers. This is made possible with an enhanced keyword-search mechanism that can, with added parameters, consider OCR-mistakes as well as synonyms. Furthermore, other Impresso tools like Ngram, to give an example, permitted seeing the occurrences of certain keywords over time.
We were then divided into groups and had the task of exploring specific aspects of Impresso on any given subject. As group 4, we analysed the information given by the Ngram tool of Impresso about sorcery as a chosen topic with the keywords “sorcellerie” and “Hexerei”, giving 6.884 results, which was further refined with the added language filter of “Luxembourgish” gave us 8 results nonetheless who were concentrated around the very early 20th century. We then used the country filter to see specifically the results from Luxembourg alone. Care must be taken with such results as bias are very easily conceived and a researcher can easily only see what he likes to see or expected.
Lastly, we were introduced to Github, a social platform aimed at programmers, which we will use to submit our weekly summaries via a coding language called “Markdown”.

## Reflexion on the 16th of October 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During this lesson, we discussed the use of digital maps in History and were acquainted with the Website “Storymaps”. Subsequently, we were put into groups and each had to create a Storymap around a selected project using digital maps to highlight a specific topic. Our project, called “Atlascine”, is a project with the purpose of collecting and mapping audiovisual media, specifically oral accounts of a variety of events in people’s personal histories.
We experienced technical difficulties regarding the introduction video on Atlascine whose sound didn’t work initially, gave us a delay. For our Storymap, we collected the information the site offered to answer the four questions related to our group work, which were the goal of the project, how to the maps support the oral accounts, if they did actually help and what we can get from this.
For our attempt at Storymap, we added our collected answers and their respective questions chronologically on the Storymap and included three screenshots taken from Atlascine showcasing, respectively, with captions under each, how the said parts of an oral account are highlighted via a circle on the map, how one can select between coloured themes but also, certain limitations, like the highlighted part at times not, when clicked, not going to the matching text part. It is to the core and looks like a standard article on a generic website in a way.
The group who did “Preserving Society Hill” went similarly with their set of questions, however in keywords instead of text, but most importantly, they added, beyond an image, an interactive map that shows the neighbourhood in a local map, highlighted in a blue square, which, when clicked on gives us on a small globe the exact location of the area in a much wider geographical context.

## Summary of the 23rd of October 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

For the 23rd of October lesson, we were touched upon the subject of networks and their visualisation and how they could be utilised efficiently by historians to illustrate information given by a set of sources, allowing the recognition of patterns or prominence of a certain figure/aspect, left otherwise obscure. We were introduced to this concept of networks via the example of a wedding and the planification of the different guests attending, their attributes (here for example coworkers, singles, friends etc.) and how they are grouped on that network. We were met with other types of occurrences and notions around these social networks like brokers, to give an example, and the general boundaries of a network.
We used a site called Palladio that allows the visualisation of networks through spreadsheets files like the ones on Excel. We were later tasked with creating our own network to visualize via Excel and Palladio. Initially, I had the idea of creating one related to Rock and Heavy Metal bands and how they could be linked with each other but due to time constraints and not being sure how to make it work, I banded together with Emilie and Jelena to work on a new wedding guest list to have a more familiar basis, as the topic matter wasn’t always easy to follow.
