## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25-09-2024

During the session, we learned about and discussed the use of data and metadata. We learned that data is not only something for computer scientists and mathematicians, but that it has a place in many industries and in our private lives due to digitalization. Big data is becoming an integral part of historical sources. We have taken a closer look at what data and metadata are, where they come from and how they can become a historian's tool for scientific research. Furthermore, we have defined that data is something that anyone can create, record, store, observe and analyze. It is very easily accessible and is becoming increasingly widespread through digitization. Metadata is used to describe data. It is created automatically by technology, but can be enhanced by a person or a group. We got the explanation visually with the help of a YouTube video and for further understanding we looked at data sets (Excel) and Twitter posts. Next, we got a brief introduction to Tropy and saw what we could do with it. Finally, we discussed and found out how classmates used data for their thesis. While we were learning all this, we also produced data ourselves while taking notes on Word, and we produced even more by completing this assignment. The course was very interesting. I know that data is very present in my life, but it is something that I am not actively aware of and therefore never really pay attention to. Data can make life and work easier, but I still need to learn how to deal with it. And I should no longer ignore it.

## Web Archives, 02-10-2024

During the class we were divided into groups. The task was to analyze non-profit web archives within about 30 minutes and present them to the class. My group was given the topic “Fluidity of the web” and we had three questions to work on, so we split up the questions and worked indidivelately at first, but we helped each other when we found information that matched the question of the respective assigned person. To answer my question, I looked at the profiles that edited the Wikipedia page, I found two Bots. Bots add information or links to open repositories and fix common errors, but bots cannot recognize when databases contain errors or incomplete information. So they rely on the help of humans. But humans can be biased. I was able to find personal information about the user, such as their religion, origin or job, but some profiles did not contain personal information. 
From the first presentation we mainly learned that it currently results in a lot of lawsuits from companies like book publishers, because these websites provide protected documents and therefore violate laws. In the following, we have learned about the role of the Bnl and Luxembourg Web Archive. The BnL collects, preserves and catalogs all publications related to the Grand Duchy and we learn that the internet/website are not available for eternity. Sources on the internet disappear or are no longer readable/up-to-date. We also see this later in the example of the website The September 11 Digital Archive. Then we learned about Micro-archiving: Family and personal archives in the digital age. Where the students find some information about themselves and family. At the last presentation we learned that many documents are not relatable because many were marked as unkown. We can't trace it's origin back properly.

## Impresso, 09-10-2024

This course was again more about experimentation and independent exploration. In the first part of the lesson we were introduced to the Impresso website. Before that we had to read an article about Impresso that gave background information and explanations to help us follow the course better and sign a contract. In the course itself we were again divided into groups after the presentation and given the task of working with the tools and trying them out to get more familiar with the website. In my group we explored Inspect & Compare. This took a while and required a little help to get familiar with it. The first time we got no result, we tried to get results by translating the word „NATO Doppelbeschuss“ decision into French. The second time we got a result. This time we used the words „NATO Doppelbeschuss“ and Helmut Schmidt. We were then given the task of transferring our results to PowerPoint. In the last part of the course we had to present our founding in a short presentations. The short presentation not only helped us find out what our classmates are interested in, but also made us aware of limitations and other opportunities and gaps. Impresso is an interesting and helpful tool that I can use as a student of the university of luxembourg both for my thesis and for other presentations at the university. 
At the end of the course we talked about GitHub, which helped me better understand why we should use GitHub.

## Map, 16-10-2024

We did an exercise where we drew a map of our campus and the results varied. There were different starting points (packaging, train station, university buildings etc.), which showed us that maps are subjective. I also found it interesting that some took a different perspective when drawing a map. Some drew the buildings from a two-point perspective, others from a bird's eye view. After the presentation, I realized that I had misunderstood some things in the article and left out important details. For example, that a location is a specific place and space is a social construct. Both are two different things. Maps are sources. Much depends on who made the map (who commissioned it?) and who uses the map. Maps are not always accurate or/and have gaps. GIS (Geographic Information System) works in layers, which we can turn on and off.(can be used as a comparison tool) GIS is not equal maps. GIS also works without a map. We need geographical points for maps, scales and a compass direction. Data in a map can be represented in different ways. And boundaries change when we compare maps with each other. In the third part of the course we were divided into groups and had 1 hour to work on a story map. I was in the group with the Travel industry and i looked at the story map of the Olympic marathon. The group worked with bullet points, while our group wrote sentences. In their map you can see streets, houses and fields. Which makes sense in their map and would be rather superfluous in our map. Ours, although has a simple design, but it was still overwhelming due to the many symbols and text. Our map even included 2 more maps and a catalog and a diagram. Our map shows the Globus trading market, while the Olympia Group map is designed to show a specific location. Used for measuring and document a distance. (A staring point and final destination) They also had a chronology and multiple maps so you could compare them with each other, see an evolution. Both maps tell an individual story. The Olympia Group map uses pictures and text, and our map uses symbols, text and drawings and uses colors to provide more detail/a hierarchy.

## Palladio, 23-10-2024
For this lesson we looked at networks and Palladio. We had to read 2 articles, an introduction where the origins, the pioneers and what it is used for were explained.
We also had to read a tutorial, which I followed while reading.
The lesson itself revolved around the topic: Why are networks important and why do historians want to study them?
We collected ideas on the topic of wedding planning. Through the simulation (with the table extension) that we created, we see that there are already existing relationships, but there are also people who do not know each other yet. We can group them by age, languages, interests and relationship status, to see which people can be divided into which table. Left is always a group of "odd one" (which is not easy to put in a group). There are different dynamics in different tables. In the sense of relationship, communication and dominance. Someone can control multiple conversations; who talks to whom and who limits themselves to a few people. When different groups meet, different information is exchanged, but this does not necessarily mean that this information reaches everyone in the group. In networks there are also brokers. They are powerful (they have control, can decide whether to pass on information or keep it to themselves.) Over time, structures and dynamics can change. New network can emerge, e.g. some find themselves in the wedding. (Lovers) 
Afterwards we had a PowerPoint presentation. Where we learned what a social network. A specific set of links. (we saw different types in class) We can use it to explain why people behave differently in different groups. (Ex: smoking behavior, voting behavior etc.) Our behavior can also destroy networks. Relationships are important and how you are connected to them. Networks are flexible. Cases can be represented visually and networks are not limited to people. Social network analysis is both theory and method. Today, everything can be defined as a network. (expl: Family network) From the historical perspective, network can guide us to the self-perception of historical actors, to the metaphor for a group, to the constructed scientific research object and to the theory/method driven research approach.
Finally, we had the task of creating our own wedding list. My group created this on Excel and used the table in Palladio. Thus, we created our own fictional network.
