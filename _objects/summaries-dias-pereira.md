## Data, Metadata and Tool 2 Tropy, 25th of September 2024
In the last class the main topic was data and metadata and how historians can use data as a tool for their research. We watched a video which explained the difference between the two. To understand what data actually is, we took an example of a tweet on the platform X. The tweet in question gave us different information. Just by the screenshot, you could find information, like the username, the date when it got published, the exact time, who commented it, who liked it and who reposted it. Those elements represent data. Metadata is something different. In the video, they explained that metadata is data of the data, basically information of the data. 
We also talked about Zotero and how it can be helpful for us history students. I already knew that tool and I think it’s helpful for us students, because it allows you to put all the important information about the author, the article, etc. in one place, and depending on what citation style you want to cite, it does this work for you. It’s also useful to have all your bibliography in one storage. 
One negative aspect I still must mention, but it doesn’t really concern your class, is the fact that the citation style of Ons Hémecht isn’t available on Zotero, which is important especially for us history student at the University of Luxembourg, because we have to use that citation style.
