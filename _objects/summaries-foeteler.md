## Summary of the second session, [25.09.2024]
<!--one to two paragraphs of text summarizing the session-->

<!-- create such a section for each weekly summary-->
During this session, held by Madame Sofia Papastamkou, we mainly learned about the topic of
data and metadata. The teacher showed us the differences between those two terms and how we
can find data and use it for our advantage. We were also shown different examples to visualize
and better understand this complex topic with a photo on Flickr and even a Tweet. An
interesting question that the teacher asked was if we, the students, had used data for our work.
Another thing that we learned about was the New York public library and their web archives. I
thought this was very interesting and nice to know for the future.
For me personally, this session was hard to understand and hard to follow because Iâ€™m not very
into that specific topic of data and metadata. There was a lot of new information to understand
and digest, which I found difficult to do. In addition, I found it rather sad that the introduction
to Tropy was very short and just done in the last few minutes of the lesson. This should become
a tool to use in the future because it seems to have a lot of perks that can favour our research
for the Master thesis, for example. I thought the session should have been structured differently.
I am a learning-by-doing kind of student, so I would prefer that we would go through the
practical stuff together in class and get some at home reading on the more theoretical parts of
the course.
