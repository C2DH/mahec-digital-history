## [Summary of the third session], [02.10.2024]
<!--one to two paragraphs of text summarizing the session-->

<!-- create such a section for each weekly summary-->

This session was structured differently than the last one. In the beginning we were told the
program of the session and that there would be an election for the student representative for the
MAHEC. After this, Madame Papastamkou gave us an explanation of the following group work
that had to be done in class. We had to form groups and chose a topic to work on for around 30
minutes to be able to present it to the class afterward. My group chose the third assignment
surrounding the archiving of the website “Luxembourg.lu”. I found this very interesting because
we could actively familiarize ourselves with a new topic. I have never worked with an internet
archive and the Wayback machine was also a new tool for me.
During our group work, we could see the evolution of this page over the years, and we could
recognize some important changes. In comparison from the first capture to the most recent one,
we could see that it looked way more modern, and the colours of the national flag are
omnipresent. You also have the possibilities to change the language and the whole site is filled
with information for tourists. In addition, the viewer of the website can also enlarge his

knowledge about the Luxembourgish history but also get to know our traditions and culture.
With the Wayback machine my group could analyse different statistics and could see various
diagrams based on data.
Overall, I liked this session, because we could work on something hands on and understand the
importance and the frequency of data and metadata. I will include the Internet archive in my
research for different projects, because I think it is something very special and I think it is
important to see how things evolve over the years.

## Summary of the second session, [25.09.2024]
<!--one to two paragraphs of text summarizing the session-->

<!-- create such a section for each weekly summary-->
During this session, held by Madame Sofia Papastamkou, we mainly learned about the topic of
data and metadata. The teacher showed us the differences between those two terms and how we
can find data and use it for our advantage. We were also shown different examples to visualize
and better understand this complex topic with a photo on Flickr and even a Tweet. An
interesting question that the teacher asked was if we, the students, had used data for our work.
Another thing that we learned about was the New York public library and their web archives. I
thought this was very interesting and nice to know for the future.
For me personally, this session was hard to understand and hard to follow because I’m not very
into that specific topic of data and metadata. There was a lot of new information to understand
and digest, which I found difficult to do. In addition, I found it rather sad that the introduction
to Tropy was very short and just done in the last few minutes of the lesson. This should become
a tool to use in the future because it seems to have a lot of perks that can favour our research
for the Master thesis, for example. I thought the session should have been structured differently.
I am a learning-by-doing kind of student, so I would prefer that we would go through the
practical stuff together in class and get some at home reading on the more theoretical parts of
the course.
