## Summary Session 2, 25 Septembre 2024

During this seminar, we talked about data and metadata, research data and got a brief introduction to the Tropy software. In today’s digital age historians, all have to use digital resources at some point in their work, but that doesn’t make every Historian a Digital History Historian. 
Digital History is historical research based on primary sources accessible as electronic data. It can be both digitised sources and born-digital sources.
Data is what can serve as the basis for an analysis, research, data is information. Data can be digital elements that we create, collect, store, manipulate, analyse, interpret, preserve and make available.
There are different research phases. First, we search, localise and gather research materials (Heuristics), then these need to be analysed and interpreted. Then organised and published. The materials also need to be preserved (archived).
Research data are descriptive elements of reality. Qualitative data is gained by observation and quantitative data by measurements. Research data is collected, structured and organise so that we can obtain information and gain knowledge.
Metadata is information about the data. Metadata can be very useful, to find, identify and organise data, evaluate information and provide context. We can use systems to generate metadata. There are two types of metadata, embedded (which is automatically generated by a machine) and enriched (added by a creator or user).
Tropy can be used to organise and archived digital pictures all in one place, in a project and add metadata to them for a better organisation and identification of the data.

## Summary Session 3, 02 October 2024

In this course we saw multiple web archives. For this session we were divided in small groups, who each had an assignment that they later had to present to the others.
The first assignment focused on the challenges of archiving the web, based on a text by Chris Stokel-Walker. The Internet, archive; a non-profit that uses bots make copies of websites to preserve websites for future research. However, issues like copyright and the impossibility to archive everything remain problematic.
The second assignment looked at the Luxembourg Web Archive managed by the BNL. The BNL goal is to preserve all Luxembourg-related websites but cannot archive all, they must prioritize some. This archive is only accessible within the BNL’s network. The website takes 4 screen shots from the concern sites per year.
For the third assignment, the group had to use the Wayback Machine to compare the 1996 and current versions of the website luxembourg.lu. The Wayback Machine, unlike the BNL, relies on user submissions to capture site screenshots.
In the fifth assignment, it was about the fluidity of the web, the exercise focused on Wikipedia, where information can be easily edited by anyone, so we must be careful of possible for fake content.
The sixth assignment was about the publishing of family and personal archives on the web. It made us reflect on the digital traces we leave behind, particularly through the publication of personal and family archives on the web.
Finally, assignment seven examined the "September 11 Digital Archive," a project to preserve multimedia about 9/11. The site was created directly in 2002. While it has interesting data, the lack of metadata makes the archive difficult for historians to use.
