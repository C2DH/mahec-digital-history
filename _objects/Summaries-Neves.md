## Summary Session 2 "Form Sources to Data", 25 Septembre 2024

During this seminar, we talked about data and metadata, research data and got a brief introduction to the Tropy software. In today’s digital age historians, all have to use digital resources at some point in their work, but that doesn’t make every Historian a Digital History Historian. 
Digital History is historical research based on primary sources accessible as electronic data. It can be both digitised sources and born-digital sources.
Data is what can serve as the basis for an analysis, research, data is information. Data can be digital elements that we create, collect, store, manipulate, analyse, interpret, preserve and make available.
There are different research phases. First, we search, localise and gather research materials (Heuristics), then these need to be analysed and interpreted. Then organised and published. The materials also need to be preserved (archived).
Research data are descriptive elements of reality. Qualitative data is gained by observation and quantitative data by measurements. Research data is collected, structured and organise so that we can obtain information and gain knowledge.
Metadata is information about the data. Metadata can be very useful, to find, identify and organise data, evaluate information and provide context. We can use systems to generate metadata. There are two types of metadata, embedded (which is automatically generated by a machine) and enriched (added by a creator or user).
Tropy can be used to organise and archived digital pictures all in one place, in a project and add metadata to them for a better organisation and identification of the data.

## Summary Session 3 "Web archives", 02 October 2024

In this course we saw multiple web archives. For this session we were divided in small groups, who each had an assignment that they later had to present to the others.
The first assignment focused on the challenges of archiving the web, based on a text by Chris Stokel-Walker. The Internet, archive; a non-profit that uses bots make copies of websites to preserve websites for future research. However, issues like copyright and the impossibility to archive everything remain problematic.
The second assignment looked at the Luxembourg Web Archive managed by the BNL. The BNL goal is to preserve all Luxembourg-related websites but cannot archive all, they must prioritize some. This archive is only accessible within the BNL’s network. The website takes 4 screen shots from the concern sites per year.
For the third assignment, the group had to use the Wayback Machine to compare the 1996 and current versions of the website luxembourg.lu. The Wayback Machine, unlike the BNL, relies on user submissions to capture site screenshots.
In the fifth assignment, it was about the fluidity of the web, the exercise focused on Wikipedia, where information can be easily edited by anyone, so we must be careful of possible for fake content.
The sixth assignment was about the publishing of family and personal archives on the web. It made us reflect on the digital traces we leave behind, particularly through the publication of personal and family archives on the web.
Finally, assignment seven examined the "September 11 Digital Archive," a project to preserve multimedia about 9/11. The site was created directly in 2002. While it has interesting data, the lack of metadata makes the archive difficult for historians to use.

## Summary Session 4 "Impresso", 10 October 2024

During this session we learned about Impresso. There are two Impresso projects. The first one is called ‘Media Monitoring of the Past (2017–2020)’, it’s the project we talked the most during the session. The second is called ‘Impresso II. Media Monitoring of the Past – Beyond Borders (2023–2027), this one was only briefly mentioned. We learned that Impresso was originally a Swiss-Luxembourgish collaboration, now in the second projects they are incorporating other countries as well. Impresso I digitalise newspapers from Luxembourg and Swisse from the 17th century to the 21st century. Sadly, the newspaper collections are pretty unbalanced in size. Some years have much more newspapers than others. Especially for the older newspapers, since many of them disappeared before being digitalized. In recent years the copyright is an issue. Since the site has collections in French, German, Luxembourgish and English sometimes the results of the ‘NGRAMS’ (used to compare the appearance of terms in a year, example ‘greve’ ‘streik’) can be misleading because the number of collected newspapers in the different languages can be very different per year.  
We were divided into groups to explore the different functionalities of Impresso. My group choose to try out the ‘NGRAMS’ we tried with comparing the results for two terms for witchcraft, ‘sorcellerie’ and ‘Hexerei’. We applied the language filter to see only Luxembourgish articles, it showed us 8 results around the early 20th century. We also tried the country filter to see how many articles were published here when and what language German or French.
At the end of the session, we were really quickly introduced to GitHub and how it works to make our own files with the coding language ‘markdown’.

## Summary (Reflexion) Session 5 "Maps/StoryMaps", 16 October 2024

In this session about maps, we got a brief introduction on what maps are, what type of maps there are and how and why to use it in historical research. 
Then we were divided into groups to explore different sites with maps and then do a story map about it. My group worked on the site ATLASCINE it’s a site combining audiovisual storytelling with transcriptions and a map. 
For the story map we did it quite simply, we used the mode ‘récit’. We worked with simple text and explained ATLASCINE by answering 4 questions. We also inserted some screen shots in our text he to have a visual representation. The insertion of images is very simple more than on Word. Inserting a legend is also simpler because the option shows up automatically on Story maps on Words it doesn’t. Even though we only used the text option and image option for this exercise, there are many more available.
There are Classique options like the insertion of text, buttons (on which the reader can click and will be transported to a site with a URL), a separator, a table and a code. There is also multimedia content that can be inserted, like the images we used, a collection of images that are interlinked, even videos and audios. With the option ‘Balayer’ we can simplify the comparison of two maps for example for the readers. There is also the option chronologies which helps illustrate a series of events. Then there is the immersive content like map tours for example and also the option to insert various maps. All in all this site is very useful and quite easy to use.
The group that worked on the ‘John Snow Map’ used a few other options than my group, they used text and images but the image of the map changes while we scroll down the text. This is a good function because the show is always the same map but with different information highlighted on the map. Which makes it easier to understand.
