## DH Theory: Criticisms; Transparency; Reproducability/Documentation, 2024.11.06

For this week's course, I believe taking last week's network homework to have been the right choice.
This made the hands-on quite easier to understand, and then, do.
I have to admit that some parts of the theoretical part left me confused until the time for the hands-on came.
The hands-on gave me time to reflect about what has been said during the theoretical part and allowed for the dispersal of the confusion. 
Thinking back to the theoretical part, it was the right call once again to lead the students into the subject of that class with a real life example.
In this case it was doubly good since it was also a historical example, instead of a semi-imagined one like the mariage during the networking class.
The thought process for the choice of actors and generally the question of proofability of one's work with data is something a bit known to me.
I had to know a bit of it since my bachelor's thesis had me analyse a large quantity of 1930s and 1940s journals. I admit that I did not follow the FAIR procedure because I was not aware of it at the time.
Onto the hands-on, the exercice felt initially quite fantastical but being able to do it with my own, already built, network, made the exercice easier due to me knowing how I chose the various nodes and edges.
This familiar ground to start one made the hands-on doable for me, which in the end led me to leave satisfied instead of frustrated, something quite common at the start of this semester in this course.
